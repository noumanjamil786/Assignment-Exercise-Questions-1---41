// If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.


let PersonName : string = "Nouman";
console.log("lowercase:",PersonName.toLowerCase()); 
console.log("Uppercase:",PersonName.toUpperCase());
